## Contributing ##

We are happy to receive pull-requests if you want to contribute new features or bugfixes to the project.
Please use the code style settings that you can find in the [code-style directory](code-style/).
If you use IntelliJ, please make sure it properly picks up the settings from the [EditorConfig file](.editorconfig)
(this should be the default behavior though).

Issues labeled [help wanted][issues-help-wanted] or [good first issue][issues-good-first-issue]
can be good first contributions.

If you want to thank the author for this library or want to support the maintenance work,
we are happy to receive a donation.
